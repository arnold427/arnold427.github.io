On the top of my webpage, I have included a navigation bar to access the information easier and applied image border for each headlines. Also, I have added a carousel banner from bootstrap to share pictures of my favorite places. Moreover, I used advanced css element to create a timeline with my resume on it. Finally, I have added a iFrame to introduce my favorite song.
